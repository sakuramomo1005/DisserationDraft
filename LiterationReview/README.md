* Definition and application of precision medicine

According to the definition promulgated by the National Institute
of Health (NIH), precision medicine refers to a new treatment
and prevention method based on understanding of individual gene,
environment and life-style.

In clinical literature reviews, it seems not innovative for widely
mixed use of “precision”, “personalized” and “individualized”.
Although the three terms share similarities, precision emphasizes
more on synchronization of new concepts, diagnosis and
treatment.


* Introduction to the Theory and Methods Special Issue on Precision Medicine and Individualized Policy Discovery

The basic premise of precision medicine is to leverage data
and clinical knowledge to optimize health care by tailoring
treatment to the uniquely evolving health status of each patient.
The data describing a patient’s health status can be complex,
comprising irregular and sparse clinic data, genetic and genomic
information, imaging data, billing and insurance information,
and so on.
