* Definition and application of precision medicine
*

According to the definition promulgated by the National Institute
of Health (NIH), precision medicine refers to a new treatment
and prevention method based on understanding of individual gene,
environment and life-style.

In clinical literature reviews, it seems not innovative for widely
mixed use of “precision”, “personalized” and “individualized”.
Although the three terms share similarities, precision emphasizes
more on synchronization of new concepts, diagnosis and
treatment.


* Introduction to the Theory and Methods Special Issue on Precision Medicine and Individualized Policy Discovery

The basic premise of precision medicine is to leverage data
and clinical knowledge to optimize health care by tailoring
treatment to the uniquely evolving health status of each patient.
The data describing a patient’s health status can be complex,
comprising irregular and sparse clinic data, genetic and genomic
information, imaging data, billing and insurance information,
and so on.

Electronic health records contain a rich database
of clinical information. In the future, algorithms
will be developed to identify patients
with disease risk factors (e.g., for patients with
diabetes and elevated low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol levels who are not taking a statin) or
with a need for guideline-based screening (e.g.,
colonoscopy on the basis of age and family history)
or to apply pharmacogenetic guidelines to
assist with drug selection and administration.

### Approaches of Precision Medicine

* Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful method in computer science that has been successfully used to teach an agent to learn to interact with the environment, aiming to achieve the best reward/return. This is quite similar to the situation in clinical practice, where a doctor needs to adopt an action (treatment regime) depending on a patient’s conditions (e.g., demographics, genetic background, clinical characteristics and previous response to a specific treatment regime). Thus, reinforcement learning can be used to solve a clinical decision problem, whereby the concept of precision medicine can be realized
