To detect differences in the mean functions
of two independent samples of curves, Ramsay & Silverman (2005) introduced a
pointwise t-test, Zhang et al. (2010) presented an L2ô€€€norm based test, Horvath
et al. (2013) proposed a test based on the sample means of the curves, and Staicu
30 et al. (2014) developed a pseudo likelihood ratio test. Extension to k independent
samples of curves was discussed in Cuevas et al. (2004), Estevez-Perez &
Vilar (2008), and Laukaitis & Rackauskas (2005), who proposed ANOVA-like
testing procedures for testing the equality of mean functions. Recent research
also focused on detecting dierences in the covariance functions of independent
35 samples of curves: see the factor-based test proposed by Ferraty et al. (2007),

* The authors proposed a Cramer-von Mises (CVM) - type of test, based on the empirical distributional functionals of the reconstructed smooth trajectories

* The authors first used a functional principal components (FPC) decomposition of the data and then employing a sequential bootstrap test to identify dierences in the mean functions, eigenfunctions, and eigenvalues. 
* However, in the proposed form, this test does not account for multiple comparisons and is dicult to study under a variety of scenarios due to its computational expense. Furthermore, even if the multiple comparisons 50 are properly accounted for, the test is still limited to detecting first and second order changes in the distribution of the FPC scores.
