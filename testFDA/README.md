To detect differences in the mean functions
of two independent samples of curves, Ramsay & Silverman (2005) introduced a
pointwise t-test, Zhang et al. (2010) presented an L2ô€€€norm based test, Horvath
et al. (2013) proposed a test based on the sample means of the curves, and Staicu
30 et al. (2014) developed a pseudo likelihood ratio test. Extension to k independent
samples of curves was discussed in Cuevas et al. (2004), Estevez-Perez &
Vilar (2008), and Laukaitis & Rackauskas (2005), who proposed ANOVA-like
testing procedures for testing the equality of mean functions. Recent research
also focused on detecting dierences in the covariance functions of independent
35 samples of curves: see the factor-based test proposed by Ferraty et al. (2007),
